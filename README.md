This repo is/will be filled with programs I have written, :eyes: mostly in **Python** because Python is awesome!
Most of these programs can be downloaded a tweaked to fit your needs or even built upon to create something greater.
:star: 

I have things like getting Nasa's :rocket: Daily Image and opening it in your default viewer, to telling your daily horoscope. :calendar:

A simple TCP Server and a 'Telnet' connector program. :computer: ---- :computer:

There is also an Excel sheet which I am sort of proud of. It takes a number in one of several formats (binary, decimal, octal, etc.) and automatically converts it into the other forms. So if you put a decimal it would convert it to every other type in the sheet. ðŸ“²

I will be updating this repo with different code snippets I have created & collected, as well as leaving links for documents that relate to the topic.
